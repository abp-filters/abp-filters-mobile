# ABP mobile filter list policy

**Purpose**

* ABP mobile filters must remove [adverts](https://easylist.to/2011/07/11/the-definition-of-advert-and-link-exchange-policy.html), although it is acceptable for them to incidentally remove tracking.
* Self-promotion should not be specifically removed by ABP mobile filters, although equally should not be whitelisted if it is blocked.
* Adverts must be blocked regardless of the reasons for their presence or the purpose that the money raised ultimately serves.
* Ads caused by malware or adware on your device will not be fixed.

**Filter evaluation**

* Evidence should be provided that filters need to be added to the subscription.
* Specific filters should only added if a substantial amount of advertising is removed by its inclusion.
* Consistently problematic filters should be removed from the filter list.

**Syntax** 

* Domains specifically serving adverts should be blocked on all third-party websites.
* Filters must be as efficient as possible.
* Only element rules based on id or class should be applied to all domains, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
* Whitelists should be specific enough to avoid protecting unwanted items.
