### This filter list is a work in progress. We don’t recommend adding it to your ad blocker. Check back here in August when we hope to have a usable list available.

# **ABP mobile filters**

Adblock Plus (ABP) filter list to improve user experience on mobile.

## **Introduction**

A long filter list can cause a bad user experience on some mobile devices. Additionally, some ads specifically target mobile devices, making some ads still visible to ad-blocking users. This is because most of the filters from traditional filter lists are made for desktop devices. Because of this, there's a need to make a filter list specifically designed for mobile devices.

This filter list is based on EasyList (including [language supplemental filter lists](https://adblockplus.org/subscriptions#type_ads)) and maintained by ABP. It’s intended to be much smaller than EasyList, and to detect and block ads on mobile. Credits go to the EasyList authors ([https://easylist.to/](https://easylist.to/)) and its community!
